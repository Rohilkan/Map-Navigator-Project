Utilizing graph traversal (depth-first search and Dijkstra's algorithms) to navigate the shortest path through highways between cities given their coordinates.

Visualize.java is used to display path between user-input starting and ending locations. It takes a background map image (.png) as well as a .vis file to show the path in real time.

StdDraw.java is imported from previous projects to draw a line along the path on the graphical user interface.
